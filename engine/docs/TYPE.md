This documentation elaborates on the essence of "type" as it relates to component values within the engine.

## The Significance of "Type" in Component Values

In the context of component values, a "type" refers to the intrinsic nature or category of data that a component possesses. It defines the kind of information or content a component encapsulates. These types are crucial for the engine to interpret and process component values accurately.
Here's a more in-depth look at the meaning and handling of component types:

- Sprite
  - Type: std::pair<std::shared_ptr<sf::Texture>, sf::Sprite>
  - Description: Represents a 2D sprite for rendering.

- Int
  - Type: int
  - Description: Stores integer values.

- PairDouble
  - Type: std::pair<double, double>
  - Description: Contains a pair of double-precision coordinates.

- PairInt
  - Type: std::pair<int, int>
  - Description: Holds 2D integer coordinates.

- Bool
  - Type: bool
  - Description: Represents a true or false value.

- Double
  - Type: double
  - Description: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers.

- Clock
  - Type: sf::Clock
  - Description: Represents a game clock for time measurement.

- IntRect
  - Type: sf::IntRect
  - Description: Defines an integer-based rectangle.

- PairPairInt
  - Type: std::pair<std::pair<int, int>, std::pair<int, int>>
  - Description: Contains nested pairs of integer values.

- SinFunc
  - Type: SinusoidalFunction
  - Description: Represents a sinusoidal function with parameters.

- VectorEntity
  - Type: std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Entity>>
  - Description: Stores a collection of entities.

- Sound
  - Type: sf::Sound
  - Description: Represents a sound in the game.

- SoundBuffer
  - Type: sf::SoundBuffer
  - Description: Stores the audio data for a sound.

- Text
  - Type: sf::Text
  - Description: Represents a text string for rendering.

- String
  - Type: std::string
  - Description: Stores a sequence of characters.

- Texture
  - Type: sf::Texture
  - Description: Stores the pixel data for a texture.

This detailed clarification of component types aids in the accurate processing of component data by the engine, ensuring that each component is correctly handled based on its inherent nature
